        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Water Cannon Fountains began with inspiration from my grandfather—a proud veteran and master craftsman who spent over 20 years hand-making pond fountains by hand. I had the privilege of working beside him for five of those years, learning the artistry, precision, and pride that went into each creation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Watching his dedication and the joy his fountains brought to families and communities planted the seed for what would eventually grow into this business. I created Water Cannon Fountains to honor his legacy and share the beauty of handcrafted water features with even more people.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Today, we continue that tradition—blending timeless craftsmanship with modern design. Whether it's transforming a garden or elevating a commercial space, our fountains are made to inspire peace, elegance, and a touch of magic.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Thank you for being a part of this journey. We're excited to help you bring your vision to life—one fountain at a time.
